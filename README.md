# 🔍 Duplicate Number Checker

This Java program checks whether an array contains **at least one duplicate** number. It uses sorting to simplify the comparison process.

## 💡 How It Works

1. The array is sorted using `Arrays.sort()`.
2. A loop checks adjacent elements for equality.
3. If a duplicate is found, the method returns `true`; otherwise, `false`.
